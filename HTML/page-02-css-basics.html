    <!-- The style allows us to design our desired tag-->
    <!-- Simple selectors of tag, class, ID and universal are a powerful way to target specific HTML elements
     apply styles to them using CSS-->

    <!-- To apply a CSS style to a class we need to denote '.' and then the class name and then write CSS-->
    <!-- To apply a CSS style to a unique ID we need to denote '#' and then the ID name and then write CSS-->
    <!-- To apply a CSS style to a universal selector, we need to denote '*' and then write CSS-->
        <!--The universal selector * matches all elements on the page-->
    <!-- We put the name of the parent then its descendant and then we can write our style so, div h3-->
    <!-- We can put div > h3 which '>' denotes the child selector so only the first two h3 tags get colored
     this does not include the h3 tag thats inside the selection tag-->
    <!-- h1 + h2 where '+' is the adjacent sibling selector, and only selects the first adjacent tag to the H1 tag-->
    <!-- h1 ~ h2 where '~' is the general sibling selector, and selects all the siblings in the current tag-->
